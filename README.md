publicly available details about the George Washington Open Source Conference for 2025

# Overview
Due to the condenced planning schedule for our conference we were not able to walk the open source walk as much as we would have liked.  This repo is an effort to rectify that and create a template for sharing more information for future conferences.

# Resources
Here is a small list of informational files supporting the conference.  Starting small with the intention to add more details in future conference.  Ideally, if I get approval, I would like to include budgets, sponsor prospectus, and other information that might help organizers of future or similar conferences.
 - [] Code of Conduct
 - [] No Show Policy
 - [] JEDI
 - [] Sponsor Prospectus
 - [] Budget (waiting on approval)
