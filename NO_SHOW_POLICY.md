# No Show Policy
Details about the No Show Policy mentioned on our conference registration page.

Our GW OSCON 2025 conference planning committee has been struggling with how to minimize no shows to prevent food waste, mispent funds, and sparce attendance, among other challenges.  We reached out to other academic OSPOs who host events and UT Austin recommended trying a no show fee.  They stated that they have very few no shows as a result of their policy, so we decided to experiment with their approach.

In the spirit of true openness and transparency, we want to make it clear that we have no plans or mechanism to collect any fees from people who register.  If you would like to go to one day of the conference, but are busy on the other day, then it is absolutely fine to register for the conference.

In the best case scenerio, attendees would email ospo@gwu.edu and notify us as soon as possible about the following:
 - If you plan to miss a particular day
 - If a conflict arises and you will not be able to attend the conference
 - If you get sick and will not be able to attend the conference

Thank you so much for your consideration.  Planning events of this size and scope is very difficult and your communication and feedback is greatly appreciated.
